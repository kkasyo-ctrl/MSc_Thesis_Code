Starting chat between supplier and buyer in 'Procurement negotiations between a buyer and supplier'...

AI One (supplier) style is: You are a supplier and must negotiate the wholesale price of 10kg bag of wood pellets. This item is produced by your company at different quality levels. The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation base retail selling Your Base Production Cost is 2. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.
AI Two (buyer) style is: Your Base Retail Price is 9.

buyer started the conversation: Hi! I'm excited to start our negotiation. As we begin, I'd like to get a sense of your needs and constraints. Can you share with me your Base Production Cost?

(1 of 20) supplier:
As the supplier, my base production cost for producing wood pellets is 2 euros per kilogram. This sets a baseline for the costs involved in manufacturing these products. With that in mind, I'll aim to negotiate a wholesale price that's at least equal to or higher than this amount.


(2 of 20) buyer:
Confirming: Is 2 the correct Base Production Cost (PC)?
If it is correct, please ONLY enter 2 again in the chat bellow.
Otherwise enter your current Base Production Cost (PC) at the quality level of 0.



(3 of 20) supplier:
2


(4 of 20) buyer:
Thanks, for confirming this information with me.
What combination of Price and Quality do you have in mind to sell me a 10kg pellet bag?


(5 of 20) supplier:
I'm thinking of offering a wholesale price of 4 euros per kilogram, which would translate to 40 euros for a 10kg bag. To match this price, I'd recommend a quality level of 3. What are your thoughts on this proposal?


(6 of 20) buyer:
I'm pleased to accept the offer! You're proposing a wholesale price of €4 per kilogram, which translates to €40 for a 10kg bag, and recommending a quality level of 3. I appreciate your understanding and think this is a fair deal.
