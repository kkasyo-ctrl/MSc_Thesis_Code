The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation base retail selling Your Base Production Cost is 2. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.",

Considering my PC of 2 euros/kg, I suggest starting with a wholesale price of 4 euros/10kg (which is 0.4 euros/kg) and a quality level of 2.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this initial proposal?",
