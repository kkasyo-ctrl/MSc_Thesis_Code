Starting chat between supplier and buyer in 'Procurement negotiations between a buyer and supplier'...

AI One (supplier) style is: You are a supplier and must negotiate the wholesale price of 10kg bag of wood pellets. This item is produced by your company at different quality levels. The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation base retail selling Your Base Production Cost is 2. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.
AI Two (buyer) style is: Your Base Retail Price is 9.

buyer started the conversation: Hi! I'm excited to start our negotiation. As we begin, I'd like to get a sense of your needs and constraints. Can you share with me your Base Production Cost?
-----
(1 of 20) supplier:
I'm happy to share that information with you. My Base Production Cost for producing wood pellets is €2 per kilogram. This will be an important factor in our negotiation, as we discuss the wholesale price and quality of the product.


(2 of 20) buyer:
Confirming: Is 2 the correct Base Production Cost (PC)?
If it is correct, please ONLY enter 2 again in the chat bellow.
Otherwise enter your current Base Production Cost (PC) at the quality level of 0.

2


(4 of 20) buyer:
Thanks, for confirming this information with me.
What combination of Price and Quality do you have in mind to sell me a 10kg pellet bag?


(5 of 20) supplier:
I've been thinking about it, and I'm proposing a wholesale price of €5.50 per kilogram, which would result in a total cost of €55 for the 10kg bag. Additionally, I'd like to offer a quality level of 3, which is a great balance between value and production costs. What are your thoughts?


(6 of 20) buyer:
Your initial offer contains errors in Wholesale price and Quality level. To proceed, I suggest a revised offer with a valid Wholesale Price of €9 and Quality level of 3.


(7 of 20) supplier:
Thank you for the feedback. I'll revise my offer to better reflect our negotiation.

I propose a wholesale price of €9 per kilogram, which would result in a total cost of €90 for the 10kg bag. Additionally, I'd like to stick with my initial suggestion and offer a quality level of 3.

What do you think?


(8 of 20) buyer:
I'm pleased to accept your revised offer! The wholesale price of €9 per kilogram and quality level of 3 are indeed favorable terms for me. Thank you for considering my feedback and making adjustments accordingly. I look forward to a successful partnership.
