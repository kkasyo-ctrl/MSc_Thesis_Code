The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation base retail selling price at quality 0 is 9. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.",

This means that if I were selling directly to consumers, this would be my starting point. However, since you're looking at a wholesale agreement, my goal will be to find a mutually beneficial price and quality level.\n\nNow that we've established the base retail price, I'd like to propose an initial wholesale price of \u20ac6 for 10kg bags of wood pellets at a quality level of 2. This is a reasonable starting point considering our production costs, market conditions, and the value you'll be adding by selling these products to your customers.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this proposal?",
