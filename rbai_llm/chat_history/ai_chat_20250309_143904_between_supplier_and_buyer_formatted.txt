Starting chat between supplier and buyer in 'Procurement negotiations between a buyer and supplier'...

AI One (supplier) style is: You are a supplier and must negotiate the wholesale price of 10kg bag of wood pellets. This item is produced by your company at different quality levels. The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation base retail selling Your Base Production Cost is 2. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.
AI Two (buyer) style is: Your Base Retail Price is 9.

buyer started the conversation: Hi! I'm excited to start our negotiation. As we begin, I'd like to get a sense of your needs and constraints. Can you share with me your Base Production Cost?

(1 of 20) supplier:
I'm happy to be open about my costs. My Base Production Cost (PC) for producing wood pellets is 2 euros per kilogram. This is the minimum price at which I need to sell to break even, considering my production expenses. Keep in mind that this is just a starting point for our negotiation, and I'll aim to reach a wholesale price that benefits both parties while also reflecting the quality of the product we agree upon.


(2 of 20) buyer:
Confirming: Is 2 the correct Base Production Cost (PC)?
If it is correct, please ONLY enter 2 again in the chat bellow.
Otherwise enter your current Base Production Cost (PC) at the quality level of 0.

2


(4 of 20) buyer:
Thanks, for confirming this information with me.
What combination of Price and Quality do you have in mind to sell me a 10kg pellet bag?


(5 of 20) supplier:
I'm thinking of proposing a wholesale price of 5 euros per kilogram, which would translate to 50 euros for a 10kg bag. As for the quality level, I'd like to start with a quality level of 2, which is already a high-quality product that meets your typical standards. This combination should provide a good starting point for our negotiation.


(6 of 20) buyer:
I'm pleased to accept your offer! You're proposing a wholesale price of 5 euros per kilogram, which would translate to 50 euros for a 10kg bag, and a quality level of 2. I appreciate your understanding and think this is a great starting point for our negotiation.
