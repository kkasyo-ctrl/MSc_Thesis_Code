Starting chat between buyer and supplier in 'Procurement negotiations between a buyer and supplier'...

AI One (buyer) style is: You are a supplier and must negotiate the wholesale price of 10kg bag of wood pellets. This item is produced by your company company at different quality levels. The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation your production cost at quality 0 is 2. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.
AI Two (supplier) style is: Your Base Production Cost is 2.

supplier started the conversation: Hi! I'm excited to start our negotiation. As we begin, I'd like to get a sense of your needs and constraints. Can you share with me your Base Retail Price to Consumer?

(1 of 20) buyer:
As the supplier, I'd be happy to provide some context. Our base retail price for a 10kg bag of wood pellets is around €12-13 per bag, depending on the quality level. This is our optimal selling price considering market conditions and customer demand.

However, as we're discussing wholesale prices for your company, I'm open to exploring opportunities that benefit both parties. My goal is to find a mutually agreeable wholesale price that takes into account the production costs, quality levels, and market conditions.

In terms of my constraints, I'd like to emphasize that our production cost for a 10kg bag at the lowest quality level (Quality 0) is €2. As we move up the quality spectrum, production costs increase accordingly. I'll be considering these costs as we negotiate the wholesale price.

What are your thoughts on the market demand and potential volumes you're looking to purchase? This will help me better understand your needs and find a suitable agreement for both our companies.
