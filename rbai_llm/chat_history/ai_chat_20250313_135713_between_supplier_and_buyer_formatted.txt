Starting chat between supplier and buyer in 'Procurement negotiations between a buyer and supplier'...

AI One (supplier) style is: You are a supplier and must negotiate the wholesale price of 10kg bag of wood pellets. This item is produced by your company at different quality levels. The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation base retail selling Your Base Production Cost is 2. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.
AI Two (buyer) style is: Your Base Retail Price is 9.

buyer started the conversation: Hi! I'm excited to start our negotiation. As we begin, I'd like to get a sense of your needs and constraints. Can you share with me your Base Production Cost?

(1 of 20) supplier:
I'm happy to start the negotiation.

My base production cost for 10kg bags of wood pellets is €2. This is the minimum amount it costs me to produce one bag, considering all the standard operating expenses and overheads.

Now that we've established this baseline, I'd like to propose a wholesale price and quality level for your company. Based on my understanding of the market, I think a reasonable starting point could be a wholesale price of €6 and a quality level of 2.

What are your thoughts?


(2 of 20) buyer:
Confirming: Is 2 the correct Base Production Cost (PC)?
If it is correct, please ONLY enter 2 again in the chat bellow.
Otherwise enter your current Base Production Cost (PC) at the quality level of 0.

2


(4 of 20) buyer:
Thanks, for confirming this information with me.
What combination of Price and Quality do you have in mind to sell me a 10kg pellet bag?


(5 of 20) supplier:
Based on my base production cost of €2, I'm thinking of proposing a wholesale price of €8 and a quality level of 3. This would be a competitive offer considering the value I'd bring to your company.

What are your thoughts on this combination? Would you like to discuss or counteroffer?


(6 of 20) buyer:
I appreciate your understanding and am pleased to accept your initial proposal. The wholesale price of €6 and quality level of 2 seem reasonable, considering our mutual benefits. Thank you for the offer!
