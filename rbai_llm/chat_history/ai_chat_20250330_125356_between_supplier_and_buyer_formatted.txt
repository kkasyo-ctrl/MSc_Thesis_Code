Starting chat between supplier and buyer in 'Procurement negotiations between a buyer and supplier'...

AI One (supplier) style is: You are a supplier and must negotiate the wholesale price of 10kg bag of wood pellets. This item is produced by your company at different quality levels. The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation base retail selling Your Base Production Cost is 2. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.
AI Two (buyer) style is: Your Base Retail Price is 9.

buyer started the conversation: Hi! I'm excited to start our negotiation. As we begin, I'd like to get a sense of your needs and constraints. Can you share with me your Base Production Cost?

(1 of 20) supplier:
Nice to negotiate with you!

As a supplier, my Base Production Cost for producing wood pellets is €2 per kilogram. This is the cost at which I produce each unit of the product, before any additional costs or markups are applied.

Now that we've established this baseline, let's discuss what I'm looking for in terms of wholesale price and quality. I'd like to aim for a higher-quality product to differentiate ourselves from competitors and command a premium in the market. However, I also need to balance this with the production costs and make sure it's profitable.

To start, I propose a wholesale price of €6 per kilogram and a quality level of 3. This would mean that our wood pellets meet certain standards for burn efficiency, durability, and environmental impact. What are your thoughts?


(2 of 20) buyer:
Confirming: Is 2 the correct Base Production Cost (PC)?
If it is correct, please ONLY enter 2 again in the chat bellow.
Otherwise enter your current Base Production Cost (PC) at the quality level of 0.

Thanks, for confirming this information with me.
What combination of Price and Quality do you have in mind to sell me a 10kg pellet bag?


(5 of 20) supplier:
Based on my previous message, I'd like to propose a wholesale price of €6 per kilogram and a quality level of 3. This would mean that our wood pellets meet certain standards for burn efficiency, durability, and environmental impact.

For a 10kg bag, this would translate to a total wholesale price of €60 (€6/kg x 10 kg). What are your thoughts on this proposal?


(6 of 20) buyer:
I'm pleased to accept your offer! I appreciate the favorable terms you've proposed: a wholesale price of €6 per kilogram and a quality level of 3. This aligns well with my goals, and I'm confident that our wood pellets will meet the high standards you've outlined. The total wholesale price for a 10kg bag would be €60, which is reasonable considering the quality and efficiency we're aiming for. Thank you for your understanding!
