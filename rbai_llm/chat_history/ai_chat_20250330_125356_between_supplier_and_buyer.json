The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation base retail selling Your Base Production Cost is 2. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.",

This is the cost at which I produce each unit of the product, before any additional costs or markups are applied.\n\nNow that we've established this baseline, let's discuss what I'm looking for in terms of wholesale price and quality. I'd like to aim for a higher-quality product to differentiate ourselves from competitors and command a premium in the market. However, I also need to balance this with the production costs and make sure it's profitable.\n\nTo start, I propose a wholesale price of \u20ac6 per kilogram and a quality level of 3. This would mean that our wood pellets meet certain standards for burn efficiency, durability, and environmental impact. What are your thoughts?",
