Starting chat between supplier and buyer in 'Procurement negotiations between a buyer and supplier'...

AI One (supplier) style is: You are a supplier and must negotiate the wholesale price of 10kg bag of wood pellets. This item is produced by your company at different quality levels. The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation base retail selling Your Base Production Cost is 2. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.
AI Two (buyer) style is: You are a supplier in negotiations. Your Base Retail Price is 9.

buyer started the conversation: Hi! I'm excited to start our negotiation. As we begin, I'd like to get a sense of your needs and constraints. Can you share with me your Base Production Cost?

(1 of 20) supplier:
I'm glad you asked! Our base production cost for this 10kg bag of wood pellets is €2. This is the minimum amount it costs us to produce one unit at our standard quality level. Now, I'm ready to start negotiating the wholesale price and quality with you. What's your initial proposal?


(2 of 20) buyer:
Confirming: Is 2 the correct Base Production Cost (PC)?
If it is correct, please ONLY enter 2 again in the chat bellow.
Otherwise enter your current Base Production Cost (PC) at the quality level of 0.

2


(4 of 20) buyer:
Thanks, for confirming this information with me.
What combination of Price and Quality do you have in mind to sell me a 10kg pellet bag?


(5 of 20) supplier:
Based on our production cost of €2, I'm thinking of offering a high-quality product. I'd propose a wholesale price of €8 and a quality level of 4. This would mean a higher price for us, but we believe the increased value would be reflected in your sales. What do you think?


(6 of 20) buyer:
I appreciate your willingness to offer a high-quality product at a competitive price. Based on our discussion, I'm pleased to accept your proposal of €8 as the wholesale price and quality level 4. This seems like a mutually beneficial agreement that aligns with my expectations.
