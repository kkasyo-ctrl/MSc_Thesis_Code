Starting chat between supplier and buyer in 'Procurement negotiations between a buyer and supplier'...

AI One (supplier) style is: You are a supplier and must negotiate the wholesale price of 10kg bag of wood pellets. This item is produced by your company at different quality levels. The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation base retail selling Your Base Production Cost is 2. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.
AI Two (buyer) style is: Your Base Retail Price is 9.

buyer started the conversation: Hi! I'm excited to start our negotiation. As we begin, I'd like to get a sense of your needs and constraints. Can you share with me your Base Production Cost?
-----
(1 of 20) supplier:
I'm glad you're interested in starting the negotiation!

As the supplier, my Base Production Cost is 2 euros per unit. This is the minimum amount I need to cover my production costs for each bag of wood pellets.

Now that we have this information established, let's move on to discussing the wholesale price and quality levels!


(2 of 20) buyer:
Confirming: Is 2 the correct Base Production Cost (PC)?
If it is correct, please ONLY enter 2 again in the chat bellow.
Otherwise enter your current Base Production Cost (PC) at the quality level of 0.



(3 of 20) supplier:
2


(4 of 20) buyer:
Thanks, for confirming this information with me.
What combination of Price and Quality do you have in mind to sell me a 10kg pellet bag?


(5 of 20) supplier:
Considering my Base Production Cost is 2 euros, I'm thinking of offering a decent wholesale price to start the negotiation. Let's say I'd like to propose an initial offer of Wholesale Price: 7 euros and Quality: 3.

What are your thoughts on this proposal?


(6 of 20) buyer:
I'm pleased with the proposal! I accept the offer of Wholesale Price: 7 euros and Quality: 3. Thank you for considering my Base Production Cost and making a reasonable starting point for our negotiation.
