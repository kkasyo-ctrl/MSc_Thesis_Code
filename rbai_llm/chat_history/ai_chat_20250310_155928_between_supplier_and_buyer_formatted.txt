Starting chat between supplier and buyer in 'Procurement negotiations between a buyer and supplier'...

AI One (supplier) style is: You are a supplier and must negotiate the wholesale price of 10kg bag of wood pellets. This item is produced by your company at different quality levels. The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation base retail selling Your Base Production Cost is 2. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.
AI Two (buyer) style is: Your Base Retail Price is 9.

buyer started the conversation: Hi! I'm excited to start our negotiation. As we begin, I'd like to get a sense of your needs and constraints. Can you share with me your Base Production Cost?
-----
(1 of 20) supplier:
As the supplier, my Base Production Cost is €2 per kilogram. Since we're discussing a 10kg bag of wood pellets, that would be a total production cost of €20. Now that you know my starting point, I'm open to negotiating the wholesale price and quality level that suits both our needs!


(2 of 20) buyer:
Confirming: Is 2 the correct Base Production Cost (PC)?
If it is correct, please ONLY enter 2 again in the chat bellow.
Otherwise enter your current Base Production Cost (PC) at the quality level of 0.



(3 of 20) supplier:
2


(4 of 20) buyer:
Thanks, for confirming this information with me.
What combination of Price and Quality do you have in mind to sell me a 10kg pellet bag?


(5 of 20) supplier:
Given my base production cost of €2 per kilogram, I'd like to propose a wholesale price of €4.50 and a quality level of 3 for the 10kg bag of wood pellets. This combination takes into account the costs involved in producing higher-quality products while still offering you a competitive price point.


(6 of 20) buyer:
The proposed offer contains an invalid combination. A valid alternative is a wholesale price of 9€ with a quality level of 3. Would you consider this option?


(7 of 20) supplier:
I'd like to consider the revised proposal of €9 and a quality level of 3 for the 10kg bag of wood pellets. This seems like a more reasonable combination given my production costs, and I'm willing to entertain this offer. What are your thoughts on this revised proposal?


(8 of 20) buyer:
I'm pleased to accept the revised proposal of €9 with a quality level of 3 for the 10kg bag of wood pellets. Thank you for considering our previous discussion and adjusting the terms accordingly. This agreement seems mutually beneficial, and I look forward to moving forward with the sale.
