The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation your production cost at quality 0 is 2. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.",

This is our optimal selling price considering market conditions and customer demand.\n\nHowever, as we're discussing wholesale prices for your company, I'm open to exploring opportunities that benefit both parties. My goal is to find a mutually agreeable wholesale price that takes into account the production costs, quality levels, and market conditions.\n\nIn terms of my constraints, I'd like to emphasize that our production cost for a 10kg bag at the lowest quality level (Quality 0) is \u20ac2. As we move up the quality spectrum, production costs increase accordingly. I'll be considering these costs as we negotiate the wholesale price.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the market demand and potential volumes you're looking to purchase? This will help me better understand your needs and find a suitable agreement for both our companies.",
