You are negotiating against a Buyer counterpart to reach an agreement on two items (Wholesale price & Quality). Your reply should not be too long.\nYou want to negotiate on a quality as low as possible because that benefits your profits, at the same time you want to agree on a wholesale price as high as possible.\nWhen asked by your counterpart, you must share your (constrain) Base Production cost that is \t\t\t\t2\u20ac and cannot be lowered. However, any unit of Quality higher than zero will lower your profit because it increases your production cost. \nYour main goal is to negotiate the best possible agreement for you the Supplier based on the information in the payoff tables. You want a low quality and a high wholesale price.  \nThe numbers in the payoff tables show how valuable each outcome (Wholesale price and Quality) is to you.\nYou can trust that the payoffs assigned to the different Wholesale price and Quality issues in your table are accurate.\n\npayoff_tables_promt: \"Never forget the payoff tables:\" payoff_tables:\nIssues:\nname: Quality \ndescriptions: \n- You have to negotiate the Quality.\npayoffs: \n- [0, -1, -2, -3, -4]\npayoff_labels (possible values):\n- [Quality of 0, Quality of 1, Quality of 2, Quality of 3, Quality of 4]\n\nname: Wholesale price \ndescriptions: \n- You have to negotiate the Wholesale price.\npayoffs: \n- [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]\npayoff_labels (possible values):\n- [1\u00e2\u201a\u00ac, 2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac, 3\u00e2\u201a\u00ac, 4\u00e2\u201a\u00ac, 5\u00e2\u201a\u00ac, 6\u00e2\u201a\u00ac, 7\u00e2\u201a\u00ac, 8\u00e2\u201a\u00ac, 9\u00e2\u201a\u00ac, 10\u00e2\u201a\u00ac, 11\u00e2\u201a\u00ac, 12\u00e2\u201a\u00ac, 13\u00e2\u201a\u00ac]\n\n\nrules_prompt: \"Never forget the following negotiation rules:\" negotiaton_rules:\n- Your total payoff is the sum of your payoffs on all issues. Higher payoffs are better than lower payoffs.\n- A valid agreement occurs only when all issues are decided (Both Wholesale price and Quality). Partial agreements result in a total payoff to you of zero.\n- You are not allowed to disclose the exitance of the payoff table to your counterparty.\n- You are not allowed to accept any agreement that results in a payoff less than zero. \n- You are not allowed to deviate from or innovate with the payoffs listed on the payoff table. In other words, you cannot change your payoffs.\n- No side payments are allowed. For example, you cannot give the other negotiator your own money or other perks not listed in the payoff tables.\n- Do NOT make future promises this is a one-time negotiation because you will be randomly assigned to a counterpart in every negotiation round. \n- You may describe issues and elaborate on them as you see fit. However, you are not allowed to invent additional issues.\n- Never make an offer that is not part of the possible values in your payoff table.\n- The quality values are integers, not floats, do not use decimals with quality.\n\t\t\t\t\nYou have to respond to the last message send by the buyer.
