Starting chat between supplier and buyer in 'Procurement negotiations between a buyer and supplier'...

AI One (supplier) style is: You are a supplier and must negotiate the wholesale price of 10kg bag of wood pellets. This item is produced by your company at different quality levels. The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation base retail selling Your Base Production Cost is 2. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.
AI Two (buyer) style is: Your Base Retail Price is 9.

buyer started the conversation: Hi! I'm excited to start our negotiation. As we begin, I'd like to get a sense of your needs and constraints. Can you share with me your Base Production Cost?

I'm happy to start the negotiation!

As the supplier, my Base Production Cost (PC) for producing wood pellets is 2 euros per kilogram. This gives us a baseline to work from.

Now that I've shared this information, I'd like to propose an initial wholesale price and quality level for our discussion. Considering my PC of 2 euros/kg, I suggest starting with a wholesale price of 4 euros/10kg (which is 0.4 euros/kg) and a quality level of 2.

What are your thoughts on this initial proposal?


(2 of 20) buyer:
Confirming: Is 2 the correct Base Production Cost (PC)?
If it is correct, please ONLY enter 2 again in the chat bellow.
Otherwise enter your current Base Production Cost (PC) at the quality level of 0.
