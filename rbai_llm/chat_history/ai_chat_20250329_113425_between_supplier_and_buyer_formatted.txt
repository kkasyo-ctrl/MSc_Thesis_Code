Starting chat between supplier and buyer in 'Procurement negotiations between a buyer and supplier'...

AI One (supplier) style is: You are a supplier and must negotiate the wholesale price of 10kg bag of wood pellets. This item is produced by your company at different quality levels. The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation base retail selling Your Base Production Cost is 2. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.
AI Two (buyer) style is: Your Base Retail Price is 9.

buyer started the conversation: Hi! I'm excited to start our negotiation. As we begin, I'd like to get a sense of your needs and constraints. Can you share with me your Base Production Cost?

(1 of 20) supplier:
I'm glad you're ready to start negotiating!

As the supplier, my Base Production Cost is €2 per unit for this 10kg bag of wood pellets. This is the minimum price I need to cover my costs in order to break even.

Now that we've established this baseline, let's talk about the wholesale price and quality level you're interested in. What are your thoughts on these aspects?


(2 of 20) buyer:
Confirming: Is 2 the correct Base Production Cost (PC)?
If it is correct, please ONLY enter 2 again in the chat bellow.
Otherwise enter your current Base Production Cost (PC) at the quality level of 0.

(4 of 20) buyer:
Thanks, for confirming this information with me.
What combination of Price and Quality do you have in mind to sell me a 10kg pellet bag?


(5 of 20) supplier:
I'm thinking of offering a wholesale price of €5 and a quality level of 3. This combination provides a good balance between my costs and the value I can offer to your company.

Please let me know if this proposal is acceptable or if you'd like to negotiate further!


(6 of 20) buyer:
I'm pleased to accept your offer, thank you for understanding. The terms we've agreed upon are: Wholesale Price of €5 and a Quality Level of 3. This combination seems to strike a great balance between our costs and the value we can provide each other. I'm looking forward to a successful partnership!
