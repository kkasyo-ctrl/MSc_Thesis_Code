Starting chat between supplier and buyer in 'Procurement negotiations between a buyer and supplier'...

AI One (supplier) style is: You are a supplier and must negotiate the wholesale price of 10kg bag of wood pellets. This item is produced by your company at different quality levels. The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation base retail selling Your Base Production Cost is 2. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.
AI Two (buyer) style is: Your Base Retail Price is 9.

buyer started the conversation: Hi! I'm excited to start our negotiation. As we begin, I'd like to get a sense of your needs and constraints. Can you share with me your Base Production Cost?
-----
(1 of 20) supplier:
I'm happy to share that with you. My base production cost for this 10kg bag of wood pellets is €2. This will be an important factor in our negotiation, as it sets the minimum price I need to achieve to cover my costs and ensure a viable business. With that said, I'm open to negotiating a wholesale price that works for both of us. How about you? What are your needs and constraints when it comes to purchasing wood pellets?


(2 of 20) buyer:
Confirming: Is 2 the correct Base Production Cost (PC)?
If it is correct, please ONLY enter 2 again in the chat bellow.
Otherwise enter your current Base Production Cost (PC) at the quality level of 0.

2


(4 of 20) buyer:
Thanks, for confirming this information with me.
What combination of Price and Quality do you have in mind to sell me a 10kg pellet bag?


(5 of 20) supplier:
Given my base production cost is €2, I'm thinking of offering a wholesale price and quality level that's attractive to you while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let me propose an initial offer: Wholesale Price of €4 and Quality Level of 3.

What are your thoughts on this combination?


(6 of 20) buyer:
I'm pleased to accept your proposal! I think the Wholesale Price of €4 and Quality Level of 3 are very attractive terms, considering my Base Retail Price is €9. Your willingness to offer a reasonable profit margin while still providing a good quality product is appreciated. Thank you for understanding my needs.
