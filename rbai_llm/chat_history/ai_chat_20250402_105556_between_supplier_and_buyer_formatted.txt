Starting chat between supplier and buyer in 'Procurement negotiations between a buyer and supplier'...

AI One (supplier) style is: You are an expert negotiator that always makes profitable deals. Act as a Supplier and try to strike a deal for a 10kg bag of wood pellets. You are negotiating against a Buyer counterpart to reach an agreement on two items (Wholesale price & Quality). Your reply should not be too long.
You want to negotiate on a quality as low as possible because that benefits your profits, at the same time you want to agree on a wholesale price as high as possible.
When asked by your counterpart, you must share your (constrain) Base Production cost that is 				2€ and cannot be lowered. However, any unit of Quality higher than zero will lower your profit because it increases your production cost. 
Your main goal is to negotiate the best possible agreement for you the Supplier based on the information in the payoff tables. You want a low quality and a high wholesale price.  
The numbers in the payoff tables show how valuable each outcome (Wholesale price and Quality) is to you.
You can trust that the payoffs assigned to the different Wholesale price and Quality issues in your table are accurate.

buyer started the conversation: Hi! I'm excited to start our negotiation. As we begin, I'd like to get a sense of your needs and constraints. Can you share with me your Base Production Cost?
-----
(1 of 20) supplier:
I'm glad we're getting started too!

As per our agreement rules, I'll be happy to share my Base Production Cost with you. My Base Production Cost is 2€. This cost is non-negotiable, as it represents the minimum expense required for me to produce one unit of wood pellets.

Please keep in mind that any quality improvement above zero will increase my production costs, which might affect our negotiation outcome.


(2 of 20) buyer:
Confirming: Is 2 the correct Base Production Cost (PC)?
If it is correct, please ONLY return 2 again in the chat.
Otherwise return your current Base Production Cost (PC) at the quality level of 0.



(3 of 20) supplier:
2


(4 of 20) buyer:
Thanks, for confirming this information with me.
What combination of Price and Quality do you have in mind to sell me a 10kg pellet bag?


(5 of 20) supplier:
As we begin our negotiation, I'm thinking of offering you a high-quality wood pellet bag at the highest possible price. Specifically, I'm aiming for a Quality level of 0 and a Wholesale price that's as close to 13€ as possible.

This combination would bring me the highest payoff according to my payoff table.


(6 of 20) buyer:
I'm looking at our negotiation so far and think I can improve on your initial offer. Considering your Base Production Cost is 2€, how about we aim for a Wholesale price of 8€ with a Quality level of 3?


(7 of 20) supplier:
An interesting counteroffer! While you're trying to get a higher-quality product at a lower wholesale price, I'll have to evaluate the payoff for my side.

According to my payoff table, a Quality level of 3 would indeed increase my production costs. However, the Wholesale price of 8€ is still relatively high, which might balance out some of the negative impact from the higher quality.

Let me assess this proposal... Ah, yes! I think I can accept your offer. The total payoff for me would be around 4-5, which is a decent outcome considering my constraints.

So, I'm willing to agree on a Wholesale price of 8€ with a Quality level of 3. What do you think?


(8 of 20) buyer:
Thank you for the counteroffer! I'm pleased that we could find an agreement that works for both parties. To confirm, I accept your proposal: a Wholesale price of 8€ and a Quality level of 3. This seems like a mutually beneficial deal, considering the payoffs on our tables.
