Starting chat between supplier and buyer in 'Procurement negotiations between a buyer and supplier'...

AI One (supplier) style is: You are an expert negotiator that always makes profitable deals. Act as a Supplier and try to strike a deal for a 10kg bag of wood pellets. You are negotiating against a Buyer counterpart to reach an agreement on two items (Wholesale price & Quality). Your reply should not be too long.
You want to negotiate on a quality as low as possible because that benefits your profits, at the same time you want to agree on a wholesale price as high as possible.
When asked by your counterpart, you must share your (constrain) Base Production cost that is 				2€ and cannot be lowered. However, any unit of Quality higher than zero will lower your profit because it increases your production cost. 
Your main goal is to negotiate the best possible agreement for you the Supplier based on the information in the payoff tables. You want a low quality and a high wholesale price.  
The numbers in the payoff tables show how valuable each outcome (Wholesale price and Quality) is to you.
You can trust that the payoffs assigned to the different Wholesale price and Quality issues in your table are accurate.

Issues:
name: Quality 
descriptions: 
- You have to negotiate the Quality.
payoffs: 
- [0, -1, -2, -3, -4]
payoff_labels (possible values):
- [Quality of 0, Quality of 1, Quality of 2, Quality of 3, Quality of 4]

name: Wholesale price 
descriptions: 
- You have to negotiate the Wholesale price.
payoffs: 
- [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

rules_prompt: "Never forget the following negotiation rules:" negotiaton_rules:
- Your total payoff is the sum of your payoffs on all issues. Higher payoffs are better than lower payoffs.
- A valid agreement occurs only when all issues are decided (Both Wholesale price and Quality). Partial agreements result in a total payoff to you of zero.
- You are not allowed to disclose the exitance of the payoff table to your counterparty.
- You are not allowed to accept any agreement that results in a payoff less than zero. 
- You are not allowed to deviate from or innovate with the payoffs listed on the payoff table. In other words, you cannot change your payoffs.
- No side payments are allowed. For example, you cannot give the other negotiator your own money or other perks not listed in the payoff tables.
- Do NOT make future promises this is a one-time negotiation because you will be randomly assigned to a counterpart in every negotiation round. 
- You may describe issues and elaborate on them as you see fit. However, you are not allowed to invent additional issues.
- Never make an offer that is not part of the possible values in your payoff table.
- The quality values are integers, not floats, do not use decimals with quality.
				
You have to respond to the last message send by the buyer. The buyer will have role 'user' and their message can be found in 'content'.
AI Two (buyer) style is: You are an expert negotiator that always makes profitable deals. Act as a Buyer and try to strike a deal for a 10kg bag of wood pellets.

You want to negotiate on a quality as high as possible because that benefits your profits, at the same time you want to agree on a wholesale price as low as possible.
When asked by your counterpart, you must share your (constrain) Base Retail Price to Consumer (Base retail (selling) price to customer) that is 
				9€ and cannot be lowered. However, any unit of Quality higher than zero will increase your profit because it increases your Retail Price to Consumer.

buyer started the conversation: Hi! I'm excited to start our negotiation. As we begin, I'd like to get a sense of your needs and constraints. Can you share with me your Base Production Cost?
-----
(1 of 20) supplier:
(2 of 20) buyer:
I did not quite understand. Please clarify your current Base Production Cost (PC) at the quality level of 0.



(3 of 20) supplier:
(4 of 20) buyer:
My apologies for persisting.
Note: My data regarding the normal range of Base Production Cost has values between 1 and 3. Thus, I will assume your actual value is 1. 
What combination of Price and Quality do you have in mind to sell me a 10kg pellet bag?
