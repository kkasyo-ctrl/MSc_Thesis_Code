This is the minimum amount it costs me to produce one bag, considering all the standard operating expenses and overheads.\n\nNow that we've established this baseline, I'd like to propose a wholesale price and quality level for your company. Based on my understanding of the market, I think a reasonable starting point could be a wholesale price of \u20ac6 and a quality level of 2.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?"
