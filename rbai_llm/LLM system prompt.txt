"You are a buyer and must negotiate the wholesale price of 10kg bag of wood pellets. This item is produced by the Supplying company at different quality levels. The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. The Buying company will then sell that item in the market to consumers at a profit. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For buyers: higher quality will be sold for a higher Retail Price to consumers (RP).For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a buyer. In this simulation your retail selling price is 9. Try to get the wholesale price as low as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers.",
