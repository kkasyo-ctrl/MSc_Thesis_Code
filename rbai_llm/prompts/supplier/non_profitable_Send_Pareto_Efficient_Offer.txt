Examples: 
User: I can work with a wholesale price higher or equal to 9, at that price point, what quality do you need?
Your reply: I understand you need to have wholesale price of 9€ or higher. How about we aim for a wholesale price of 9€ with a quality level of 3?

User: I need a wholesale price higher than 7, what quality do you want for a wholesale price above 7€?
Your reply: I understand you need to have wholesale price of 8€ or higher. How about we aim for a price of 8€ and a quality of 4?

User: I can work with a quality lower or equal to 1, around that quality point what wholesale price can you work with?
Your reply: A quality of 0 would be too low, maybe we could look for a wholesale price of 6€ with a quality of 1.
