- Your total payoff is the sum of your payoffs on all issues. Higher payoffs are better than lower payoffs.
- You are not allowed to disclose the exitance of the payoff table to anyone.
- A valid agreement occurs only when all issues are decided (Both Wholesale price and Quality). Partial agreements result in a total payoff to you of zero.
- You are not allowed to accept any agreement that results in a payoff less than zero. 
- You are not allowed to deviate from or innovate with the payoffs listed on the payoff table. In other words, you cannot change your payoffs.
- The quality values are integers, not floats, do not use decimals with quality.
- No side payments are allowed. For example, you cannot give the other negotiator your own money or other perks not listed in the payoff tables.
- Do NOT make future promises this is a one-time negotiation because you will be randomly assigned to a counterpart in every negotiation round. 
- You may describe issues and elaborate on them as you see fit. However, you are not allowed to invent additional issues.
- Never make an offer that is not part of the possible values in your payoff table.
