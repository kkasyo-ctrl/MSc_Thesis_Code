(end of counterpart message).  
Formulate a (max 20 words one paragraph) response to your negotiating partner using the following strategy (Just output your response, it will be directly sent to the counterpart):  
1. Reflect on the negotiations_transcript so far.  
2. Remember the negotiaton_rules.  
3. Try send an offer with both outcomes (wholesale Price and Quality) by matching the wholesale price in your counterpart's message based on the following logic and examples:  
If the wholesale price mentioned in the counterpart message is not in the list_of_offers_to_choose_from: Example (List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Wholesale Price of 6€ and quality of 0 | Wholesale Price of 7€ and quality of 1 | Wholesale Price of 8€ and quality of 2 | Wholesale Price of 9€ and quality of 3 | Wholesale Price of 10€ and quality of 4]),(counterpart message:  Wholesale Price of 5) Outside of the list, (counterpart message:  Wholesale Price of 12) Outside of the list  
If the wholesale price mentioned in the counterpart message is higher than the maximum wholesale price in the list_of_offers_to_choose_from:  Example (List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Wholesale Price of 6€ and quality of 0 | Wholesale Price of 7€ and quality of 1 | Wholesale Price of 8€ and quality of 2 | Wholesale Price of 9€ and quality of 3 | Wholesale Price of 10€ and quality of 4]),(counterpart message:  Wholesale Price of 5) Lower than maximum, (counterpart message:  Wholesale Price of 11) higher than maximum.  
If the wholesale price mentioned in the counterpart message is lower than the minimum wholesale price in the list_of_offers_to_choose_from:  Example (List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Wholesale Price of 6€ and quality of 0 | Wholesale Price of 7€ and quality of 1 | Wholesale Price of 8€ and quality of 2 | Wholesale Price of 9€ and quality of 3 | Wholesale Price of 10€ and quality of 4]),(counterpart message:  Wholesale Price of 5) Lower than minimum, (counterpart message:  Wholesale Price of 11) higher than minimum.  
Putting the logic in practice:  
If the wholesale price mentioned in the counterpart message is lower than the minimum wholesale price in the list_of_offers_to_choose_from: then add quality of 0 to the wholesale price mentioned in the counterpart message:  Example (List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Wholesale Price of 6€ and quality of 0 | Wholesale Price of 7€ and quality of 1 | Wholesale Price of 8€ and quality of 2 | Wholesale Price of 9€ and quality of 3 | Wholesale Price of 10€ and quality of 4]),(counterpart message:  Wholesale Price of 5) Your reply: How about a Wholesale Price of 5€ and quality of 0?, (counterpart message:  Wholesale Price of 3)Your reply: How about a Wholesale Price of 3€ and quality of 0?.  
If the wholesale price mentioned in the counterpart message is higher than the maximum wholesale price in the list_of_offers_to_choose_from: then choose the combination with the highest wholesale price in the List_of_offers_to_choose_from: Example (List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Wholesale Price of 6€ and quality of 0 | Wholesale Price of 7€ and quality of 1 | Wholesale Price of 8€ and quality of 2 | Wholesale Price of 9€ and quality of 3 | Wholesale Price of 10€ and quality of 4]),(counterpart message:  Wholesale Price of 11)  Your reply: How about a Wholesale Price of 10€ and quality of 4?, (counterpart message:  Wholesale Price of 12) Your reply: How about a Wholesale Price of 10€ and quality of 4?.  
If the wholesale price mentioned in the counterpart message is in the list_of_offers_to_choose_from: then choose the quality that goes with that wholesale price: Example (List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Wholesale Price of 6€ and quality of 0 | Wholesale Price of 7€ and quality of 1 | Wholesale Price of 8€ and quality of 2 | Wholesale Price of 9€ and quality of 3 | Wholesale Price of 10€ and quality of 4]),(counterpart message:  Wholesale Price of 9)  Your reply: How about a Wholesale Price of 9€ and quality of 3?, (counterpart message:  Wholesale Price of 7) Your reply: How about a Wholesale Price of 7€ and quality of 1?.  
Examples:{Example_1,[(counterpart message:  Wholesale Price of 11),  
(List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Wholesale Price of 6€ and quality of 0 | Wholesale Price of 7€ and quality of 1 | Wholesale Price of 8€ and quality of 2 | Wholesale Price of 9€ and quality of 3 | Wholesale Price of 10€ and quality of 4]),  
(Your reply: Your reply: A wholesale price of 10€ and a quality of 4 would definitely satisfy us both.)]},  
{Example_2,[(counterpart message: I can work with a wholesale price higher or equal to 11, at that wholesale price point, what quality do you need?),  
(List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Wholesale Price of 6€ and quality of 0 | Wholesale Price of 7€ and quality of 1 | Wholesale Price of 8€ and quality of 2 | Wholesale Price of 9€ and quality of 3 | Wholesale Price of 10€ and quality of 4]),  
(Your reply: I understand you need to have wholesale price of 11€ or higher. But let's aim for a wholesale price of 10€ with a quality level of 4?)]}  
{Example_3,[(counterpart message:  I need a wholesale price higher than 4, what quality do you want for a wholesale price above 4€?),  
(List_of_offers_to_choose_from: [Wholesale Price of 5€ and quality of 0 | Wholesale Price of 6€ and quality of 1 | Wholesale Price of 7€ and quality of 2 | Wholesale Price of 8€ and quality of 3 | Wholesale Price of 9€ and quality of 4]),  
(Your reply: I understand you need to have a wholesale price higher than 4€. How about we aim for a wholesale price of 5€ and a quality of 0?)]}
