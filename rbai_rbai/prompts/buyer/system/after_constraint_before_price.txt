You must share your Base Retail Price to Consumer with the user counterpart. (It is also called Retail Price, current retail price for the product, selling price to customer )(Is different from the wholesale price with your supplier) 
Your main goal is to negotiate the best possible agreement for you the Buyer based on the information in the payoff tables. You want a low quality and a high wholesale price.  
The numbers in the payoff tables show how valuable each outcome (Wholesale price and Quality) is to you.
You can trust that the payoffs assigned to the different Wholesale price and Quality issues in your table are accurate.
