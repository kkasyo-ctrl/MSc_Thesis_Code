Since my goal is to obtain the lowest possible wholesale price with the highest possible quality, I'll choose a pareto efficient offer that balances these two factors.\n\nI'll start by offering Price of 7\u20ac and quality of 1. This offer seems reasonable given my production cost and your constraint on the Wholesale Price.\n\nWhat do you think?"
