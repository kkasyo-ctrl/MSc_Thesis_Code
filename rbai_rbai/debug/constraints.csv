Thank you for sharing your Base Production Cost!

My Base Retail Price to Consumer (RP) is indeed $9.

As per my assigned constraint, I have a target profit margin of 50%. This means that the difference between my RP and the Wholesale Price should be at least 4.5 ($9 - $2 = $7, then 50% of $7 is $3.5, so adding this to $2 gives us $5.5, which rounds up to $6).

Shall we start negotiating Wholesale Price and Quality?;Based on the message, I can extract the numerical value of the constraint as follows: ###  ### * The Base Retail Price (RP) is $9, which corresponds to [9]. ### * The target profit margin is 50%, but this doesn't provide a specific numerical value. ### * The difference between RP and Wholesale Price should be at least 4.5, which means that the Wholesale Price should be at most $9 - 4.5 = $4.5. ###  ### Since there is no specific numerical value mentioned for Base Production Cost (PC), I will output an empty list []. ###  ### Therefore, the output is: ###  ### [9], [];9
