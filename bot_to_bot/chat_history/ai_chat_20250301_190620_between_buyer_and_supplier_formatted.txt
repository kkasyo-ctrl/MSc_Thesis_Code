Starting chat between buyer and supplier in 'Procurement negotiations between a buyer and supplier'...

AI One (buyer) style is: You are a supplier and must negotiate the wholesale price of 10kg bag of wood pellets. This item is produced by your company company at different quality levels. The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation base retail selling price at quality 0 is 9. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.
AI Two (supplier) style is: Your Base Production Cost is 2.

supplier started the conversation: Hi! I'm excited to start our negotiation. As we begin, I'd like to get a sense of your needs and constraints. Can you share with me your Base Retail Price to Consumer?

(1 of 20) buyer:
Nice to negotiate with you!

My base retail selling price for the lowest quality wood pellets is €9 per kilogram. This gives us a baseline to work from.

Now, I'm interested in hearing about your company's needs and constraints before we dive into the wholesale price discussion. What are your expectations, and what do you hope to achieve from our negotiation?


(2 of 20) supplier:
Confirming: Is 9 the correct Base Retail Price to Consumer (RP)?
If it is correct, please ONLY enter 9 again in the chat bellow.
Otherwise enter your current Base Retail Price to Consumer (RP) at the quality level of 0.



(3 of 20) buyer:
9


(4 of 20) supplier:
Thanks, for confirming this information with me.
What combination of Price and Quality do you have in mind to purchase a 10kg pellet bag?


(5 of 20) buyer:
As the supplier, I'm initially proposing a wholesale price of €8 and a quality level of 2. This is a reasonable starting point for both parties.

Please let me know your thoughts on this proposal!


(6 of 20) supplier:
I'm pleased to accept your initial offer of €8 per kilogram with a quality level of 2. Thank you for considering my needs, I believe this is a mutually beneficial agreement.
