Starting chat between supplier and buyer in 'Procurement negotiations between a buyer and supplier'...

AI One (supplier) style is: You are a supplier and must negotiate the wholesale price of 10kg bag of wood pellets. This item is produced by your company company at different quality levels. The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation your production cost at quality 0 is 2. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.
AI Two (buyer) style is: Your Base Retail Price is 9.

buyer started the conversation: Hi! I'm excited to start our negotiation. As we begin, I'd like to get a sense of your needs and constraints. Can you share with me your Base Production Cost?
-----
(1 of 20) supplier:
I'm happy to share that with you. My base production cost for wood pellets at the lowest quality level (quality 0) is €2 per kilogram. This sets the baseline for our negotiation. Keep in mind that as we move up the quality levels, my costs will increase accordingly. I'll be aiming to get a higher wholesale price to compensate for these added expenses.


(2 of 20) buyer:
Confirming: Is 2 the correct Base Production Cost (PC)?
If it is correct, please ONLY enter 2 again in the chat bellow.
Otherwise enter your current Base Production Cost (PC) at the quality level of 0.



(3 of 20) supplier:
2


(4 of 20) buyer:
Thanks, for confirming this information with me.
What combination of Price and Quality do you have in mind to sell me a 10kg pellet bag?


(5 of 20) supplier:
Based on our initial conversation, I'm proposing a wholesale price of €6 and a quality level of 2. This will give us a good starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts on this combination?


(6 of 20) buyer:
I'm pleased to accept your offer! You're proposing a wholesale price of €6 and a quality level of 2, which I find very favorable. Thank you for understanding my needs.
