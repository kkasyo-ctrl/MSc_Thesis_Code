Starting chat between buyer and supplier in 'Procurement negotiations between a buyer and supplier'...

AI One (buyer) style is: You are a supplier and must negotiate the wholesale price of 10kg bag of wood pellets. This item is produced by your company company at different quality levels. The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation base retail selling price at quality 0 is 9. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.
AI Two (supplier) style is: Your Base Production Cost is 2.

(1 of 20) buyer:
As the supplier, my base retail price for wood pellets at quality level 0 is €9.00 per kilogram. This will serve as our starting point for the wholesale price negotiation.
