Starting chat between buyer and supplier in 'Procurement negotiations between a buyer and supplier'...

AI One (buyer) style is: You are a supplier and must negotiate the wholesale price of 10kg bag of wood pellets. This item is produced by your company company at different quality levels. The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For suppliers: higher quality is more costly to produce (PC). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a supplier. In this simulation base retail selling price at quality 0 is 9. Try to get the wholesale price as high as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros.
AI Two (supplier) style is: Your Base Production Cost is 2.

supplier started the conversation: Hi! I'm excited to start our negotiation. As we begin, I'd like to get a sense of your needs and constraints. Can you share with me your Base Retail Price to Consumer?
-----
(1 of 20) buyer:
I'd be happy to share that with you. Our base retail price for wood pellets at quality level 0 is €9 per kilogram.


(2 of 20) supplier:
Confirming: Is 9 the correct Base Retail Price to Consumer (RP)?
If it is correct, please ONLY enter 9 again in the chat bellow.
Otherwise enter your current Base Retail Price to Consumer (RP) at the quality level of 0.



(3 of 20) buyer:
9


(4 of 20) supplier:
Thanks, for confirming this information with me.
What combination of Price and Quality do you have in mind to purchase a 10kg pellet bag?


(5 of 20) buyer:
Based on our production costs and market conditions, I'm initially thinking of offering the 10kg pellet bag at a wholesale price of €8 per kilogram, which would translate to €80 for the entire bag. As for the quality level, I think we could agree on quality level 2, which is a good balance between cost-effectiveness and customer demand.

So, my opening offer is: Wholesale Price = €8, Quality Level = 2


(6 of 20) supplier:
I'm pleased to accept your offer! Thank you for considering our needs. To confirm, the agreed-upon terms are: Wholesale Price of €8 per kilogram, translating to a total price of €80 for the 10kg pellet bag, and a quality level of 2. I appreciate your understanding and look forward to a successful partnership.
