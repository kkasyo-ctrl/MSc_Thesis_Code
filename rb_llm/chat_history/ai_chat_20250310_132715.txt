The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For buyers: higher quality is allows you to sell the product at a higher price to customers (RP). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a buyer. In this simulation base retail selling Your Base Retail Price to customers is 9. Try to get the wholesale price as low as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers, never offer non-interger values. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers.

This is the price at which I intend to sell these wood pellets to our customers.\n\nNow that we have this baseline established, I'd like to initiate the negotiation by proposing a wholesale price and quality level for the 10kg bag of wood pellets. For now, I'll suggest a wholesale price of 5 euros per kilogram, which corresponds to a medium-quality product (quality level 2). This is a starting point, and we can adjust as needed.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?"
