The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For buyers: higher quality is allows you to sell the product at a higher price to customers (RP). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a buyer. In this simulation base retail selling Your Base Retail Price to customers is 9. Try to get the wholesale price as low as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers, never offer non-interger values. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers.

I'm looking for a reasonable wholesale price that would allow me to still make a decent margin while considering your company's production costs.\n\nTo start, I'll propose a wholesale price of \u20ac5.50 per 10kg bag. This is a relatively low starting point, as I want to create some room for negotiation. What do you think?"
