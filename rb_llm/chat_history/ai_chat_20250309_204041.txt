The Buying and Supplying company need to reach a deal in terms of Wholesale Price & Quality. A higher quality level agreed upon during the negotiation has consequences: For buyers: higher quality is allows you to sell the product at a higher price to customers (RP). For the rest of the experiment, you will play the role of a buyer. In this simulation base retail selling Your Base Retail Price to customers is 9. Try to get the wholesale price as low as possible. Wholesale price can range from 1 to 13, while quality from 1 to 4, both should be integers, never offer non-interger values. Always propose wholesale price and quality as integers. Negotiation happens in euros."

However, since you're interested in buying them at a wholesale price, I'd like to explore the possibility of a discounted rate.\n\nAs we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to offer an initial wholesale price of \u20ac6 per kilogram, which translates to \u20ac60 for a 10kg bag. This is already a competitive price considering the quality and performance of our wood pellets.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this initial offer?"
